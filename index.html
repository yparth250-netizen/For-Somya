  <div class="letter">
    <p>Some nights, the distance between us feels deliberately cruel,  
    as if the world placed those 454 kilometers there to measure how deeply I want you.  
    And yet, even this distance fails to reduce you. You remain constant — present in my thoughts, my breath, my quiet moments.</p>

    <p>You don’t simply pass through my mind. You stay.  
    In the silence, in the noise, in those moments when I pretend to be unaffected.  
    I carry you close — closer than I admit — held there by memory, longing, and restraint.</p>

    <p>There is nothing gentle about the way you affect me. It’s dark, slow, and consuming.  
    I think about your touch — unhurried, familiar.  
    About the way your scent would linger, long after you’ve moved away.  
    About how a kiss from you wouldn’t be enough, only an invitation to want more.</p>

    <p>You don’t overwhelm me. You undo me — quietly, deliberately —  
    like a story that changes the reader without announcing it.</p>

    <p>If loving you carries risk, I accept it without hesitation.  
    I know that you want someone who's gonna make you feel safe in his arms, understands you and here I am
    who'll protect you and hold you with love in his arms like my babygirl
    We want the kind of love that leaves its mark, that remembers the warmth of a touch even in absence.</p>

    <p>Shona, one day I won’t have to imagine your closeness.  
    This distance will give way to hands finding each other,  
    to shared breath in the dark, to kisses that speak more honestly than words ever could.  
    Until then, remember this —</p>

    <p>You are desired — deeply, intentionally.  
    You are chosen — every day, without doubt.  
    And you are mine in the way that matters most, just as I am yours.</p>

    <p class="signature">Happy Birthday, Somu May you get whatever you want in life because you deserve it sweetheart
     I'm always with you no matters what the situation is,I love you so much baby ❤️.<br>— Parth</p>
