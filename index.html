    <p>Some nights, the distance between us feels deliberately cruel,
    as if the world placed those 454 kilometers there to measure how deeply I want you.
    And yet, even this distance fails to reduce you.
    You remain constant — present in my thoughts, my breath, my quiet moments.</p>

    <p>You don’t simply pass through my mind.
    You stay.
    In the silence, in the noise, in those moments when I pretend to be unaffected.
    I carry you close — closer than I admit —
    held there by memory, longing, and restraint.</p>

    <p>There is nothing gentle about the way you affect me.
    It’s dark, slow, and consuming.
    I think about your touch — unhurried, familiar.
    About the way your scent would linger, long after you’ve moved away.
    About how a kiss from you wouldn’t be enough,
    only an invitation to want more.</p>

    <p>You don’t overwhelm me.
    You undo me — quietly, deliberately —
    like a story that changes the reader without announcing it.</p>

    <p>If loving you carries risk,
    I accept it without hesitation
    I know that you want a someone that make      you feel safe in his arms and I'm the one 
    who protects you and hold you with love       in my arms like my babygirl 
    We want the kind that leaves its mark on
    our body,
    that remembers the warmth of a touch
    even in absence.</p>

    <p>Shona,
    one day I won’t have to imagine your closeness.
    This distance will give way to hands finding each other,
    to shared breath in the dark,
    to kisses that speak more honestly than words ever could.
    Until then, remember this —</p>

    <p>You are desired — deeply, intentionally.
    You are chosen — every day, without doubt.
    And you are mine in the way that matters most,
    just as I am yours.</p>

    <p class="signature">
    Happy Birthday, babygirl 
    I hope you get everything you want because you deserve it I wanna see you being successful and achieve every milestone in your life 
    I love you so much ❤️ .<br>
